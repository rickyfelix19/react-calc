This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Project Details:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of how Javascript library. ReactJs works
in the most basic / beginner way by making a running 'Simple Calculator App'.

### JSC and JavaScript
an example of Hello World in JSX and ReactJS is available at
index.html and helloWorld.js respectively

- ```className``` is used insted of ```class``` for adding CSS classes, as ```class``` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
- Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase- onclick will become onClick
- Self-closing tags must end in a slash e.g. <img />

### Different Type of Components:
1. Class Component
2. Simple Component
